We created a web application using Streamlit that automates the entire survey data cleaning and analysis process. The final solution allows a user to get from a raw, messy data file to a clean, interactive report with just a few clicks.

## How It Works
Upload Data: The user starts by uploading a raw survey data file (CSV or Excel) through a simple web interface.

Configure Cleaning: Using sidebar controls, the user selects which data cleaning operations to perform:

Missing Value Imputation: Automatically fills in missing data using the mean, median, or KNN method.

Outlier Handling: Detects and corrects extreme or erroneous data points.

Rule-Based Validation: Checks the data for logical inconsistencies (e.g., a 15-year-old listed as 'Employed') and corrects them.

Weight Application: Selects the column containing survey weights for accurate analysis.

Process and Analyze: With a single click on the "Run Analysis" button, the application executes the selected cleaning steps in a pipeline and then calculates key statistics, like weighted and unweighted means.

View Results & Download Report: The app instantly displays the cleaned data, a summary table of the results, and an interactive bar chart comparing weighted and unweighted estimates. The user can then download a self-contained, interactive HTML report that contains all of this information for sharing or archiving.

# Application & Features
### What if my dataset has different column names?
The application is designed to be configurable. The sidebar UI allows you to dynamically select which columns from your uploaded file should be used for imputation, outlier handling, and for applying the survey weights. The app adapts to your data's structure.

### Can I define my own custom cleaning rules?
Currently, the specific rule (Age vs. Employment_Status) is programmed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the "Expert System" capability. The number one priority for future development would be building a user-friendly "Rule Editor." This would allow an analyst to create and save their own logical checks (e.g., "If country is 'USA', then state cannot be 'Punjab'") without writing any code.

### Is the original data file modified?
No, the workflow is non-destructive. The application reads your uploaded file into memory, performs all cleaning operations on that copy, and then allows you to download the cleaned result as a new HTML or PDF report. Your original file is never altered.

### What specific machine learning model is being used?
The application uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for data imputation. It's a machine learning model that finds the most similar data points in the dataset to make an intelligent prediction for a missing value, which is significantly more accurate than using a simple average.

## Technology & Architecture
### What is the technology stack for this project?
The application is built entirely in Python and leverages a stack of powerful data science and web libraries:

Web Framework: Streamlit

Data Manipulation: Pandas & NumPy

Machine Learning & Stats: Scikit-learn & Statsmodels

Data Visualization: Plotly Express

PDF Generation: WeasyPrint & Kaleido

### Why was Streamlit chosen for this application?
Streamlit is the fastest way to build interactive data applications. It allowed us to focus on the core data science logic—the cleaning, validation, and analysis—instead of spending the majority of our time on complex front-end web development. This is ideal for rapid prototyping and demonstrating functionality in a hackathon setting.

## Vision & Impact
### How does this compare to existing tools like Excel?
While Excel is a powerful tool for manual data exploration, our application is built for automation and consistency at scale. It creates a standardized, repeatable workflow that enforces predefined quality checks and statistical methods. This dramatically reduces the risk of human error and ensures that every dataset is processed with the same methodological rigor, which is crucial for official statistics.

### What is the main business impact of this tool?
The primary impact is a massive increase in efficiency and reliability. By automating the most time-consuming and error-prone stages of data preparation, our tool can:

Reduce the time to get from raw data to final estimates from days to minutes.

Ensure methodological consistency across all projects and analysts.

Improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of the final statistics by minimizing human error.

common questions coming to mind.

1. according to problem statement we need some ai augmented web app so where are we using ai in this project.

==> AI, directly aligning with the problem statement.

## 1. Machine Learning for Data Imputation (KNN)
This is your most direct and powerful example of using AI.

The problem statement explicitly asks for a module that handles missing data using methods like "mean, median, 

KNN". While mean and median are purely statistical, 

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation is a classic Machine Learning algorithm.

How it works: To fill a missing value, KNN looks at the 'k' most similar complete data points (its "nearest neighbors") in the dataset and uses their values to make an intelligent, educated guess. This is far more sophisticated than just taking a simple average.

## 2. Intelligent Automation & Expert Systems
The core of "AI Augmentation" is building systems that automate tasks that normally require human intelligence and judgment. Your application does this in two key ways:


Outlier Detection: The application uses statistical models like the Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-score to automatically identify data points that are abnormal. This mimics the "intuition" or "suspicion" a human data analyst would have when seeing a strange value. It's an automated quality control system that encodes a form of expertise.


Rule-Based Validation: The problem statement requires checks for "rule violations" and "consistency". When you program a rule like 



"If Age < 18, then Employment_Status cannot be 'Employed'", you are creating a simple "Expert System." This is a classic branch of AI where you codify the knowledge of a human expert into a set of rules the computer can enforce automatically. This directly reduces the "laborious and error-prone" manual work mentioned in the problem description.


## How to Pitch This to the Judges 🎤
Don't just say, "We used AI." Be specific and confident. Here’s what you can say:

"Our application is 

AI-augmented, designed to tackle the most time-consuming parts of data preparation.

* For 

missing data, we've integrated a Machine Learning model, K-Nearest Neighbors, to make intelligent predictions, going far beyond simple statistical fills.

For data quality, our app has an AI-powered validation layer. It uses statistical models to automatically detect outliers and an expert rule-based system to find and flag logical inconsistencies in the data—tasks that would normally take a human analyst hours of manual review.


By automating these cognitive tasks, our tool doesn't just process data; it enhances the analyst's ability to produce high-quality statistics with speed and accuracy."

2. is it useful for any kind of data?

The short answer is: The framework is useful for most kinds of structured, tabular data (like CSVs or Excel files), but the specific cleaning modules are specialized.

## Where It Works Best ✅
The application is highly effective for any dataset that is organized in rows and columns, especially those containing a mix of numerical and categorical data. This includes:

Survey Data: This is what it was designed for, and it excels here.

Sales or Financial Data: It could easily handle datasets with sales figures, prices, and product categories.

Sensor or Log Data: It could clean numeric readings from IoT devices or logs, as long as they are in a tabular format.

## Key Limitations and Specificity 🛠️
While the overall structure is versatile, it's not a magic wand for any kind of data. Here are the key limitations:

Focus on Numeric Cleaning: The core cleaning modules we built—Imputation (Mean, Median, KNN) and Outlier Detection (IQR)—are designed to work on numbers. They cannot intelligently fix typos in a text column like "City".

Hard-Coded Rules: The rule-based validation we implemented (If Age < 18, then Employment_Status cannot be 'Employed') is specific to this dataset. To make the app truly universal, you would need to build a user interface where a user could define their own custom rules.

No Unstructured Data: The application is not designed to handle unstructured data like free-form text (customer reviews, articles), images, or audio files.

## The Verdict for Hackathon
Think of your application as a customizable workshop, not a single magic tool. You have built a powerful framework for cleaning tabular data.

How to pitch this:

"Our application provides a flexible and powerful framework for automating data cleaning for any tabular dataset. As a proof-of-concept for this hackathon, we've implemented modules specifically tailored for survey data, including a machine learning model for imputation and expert rules for validation. The modular design means this can easily be extended with new rules and cleaning techniques for other domains, like financial or marketing data."

4. why some columns are not selected for imputation

The Reason: Numeric vs. Non-Numeric Data
Think of it this way: you can calculate the average (mean) of a list of numbers like [10, 20, 30], but you can't calculate the average of a list of text values like ['New Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Kolkata'].

To prevent errors and ensure the methods are used correctly, the application automatically filters the list of columns presented in the "Select columns for imputation" multiselect box to show only those that contain numbers (integers or decimals).

## Where This Happens in the Code
This filtering happens in your app.py file. The line below creates a list called numeric_columns by selecting only the columns with a number-based data type. This is the list that gets passed to the multiselect widget.

Python

# This line in app.py filters for numeric columns
numeric_columns = df_raw.select_dtypes(include='number').columns.tolist()

# This widget then only shows the numeric columns as options
imputation_cols = st.sidebar.multiselect("Select columns for imputation:", options=numeric_columns, default=numeric_columns)
Therefore, any column containing text, dates, or other non-numeric data is intentionally excluded from the imputation options.
